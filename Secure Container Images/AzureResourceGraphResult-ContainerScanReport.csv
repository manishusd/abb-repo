One of the vulnerabilities, identified as CVE-2021-41864, allows unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow in the prealloc_elems_and_freelist function in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c, resulting in an out-of-bounds write. This could lead to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information. Another vulnerability, CVE-2021-38300, involves a flaw in the cBPF JIT compiler that may produce machine code with incorrect branches, allowing an unprivileged user to execute arbitrary kernel code. Additionally, there are vulnerabilities such as CVE-2021-3764 and CVE-2021-3744, which involve memory leaks in the ccp-ops crypto driver, and CVE-2021-37159, which is a use-after-free vulnerability in the USB High Speed Mobile Devices functionality.

The first vulnerability is found in the Linux kernel versions 3.16 through 5.13.x before 5.13.4, which allows an unprivileged user to escalate privileges to root by exploiting an integer overflow and out-of-bounds write in fs/seq_file.c. The second vulnerability affects the Oracle Communications Session Border Controller product versions 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, and 9.0, allowing a low privileged attacker to compromise the system and take over the controller. The third vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write flaw in the Linux kernel's seq_file in the Filesystem layer, affecting Amazon Linux 2. This flaw allows a local attacker with user privileges to access out-of-bound memory, potentially leading to a system crash or information leak. Lastly, a vulnerability identified as CVE-2021-33909 affects the kernel package version 5.10.168.1-1, allowing an attacker to exploit a size_t-to-int conversion vulnerability in the filesystem layer.

These vulnerabilities could allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code, cause a denial of service, or expose sensitive information. Specifically, the st21nfca_connectivity_event_received function in drivers/nfc/st21nfca/se.c is susceptible to buffer overflows due to untrusted length parameters. The nouveau graphics driver is affected by a use-after-free vulnerability during device removal. The Spectre Variant 2 mitigations for AMD processors on Linux are insufficient in some situations, potentially exposing sensitive information. The netfilter subsystem and the MMC/SD subsystem have memory initialization issues that could lead to the exposure of sensitive information. The USB gadget subsystem and the Remote NDIS (RNDIS) USB gadget implementation have validation vulnerabilities that could cause a denial of service or expose kernel memory.

"c0b7cfc6-3172-465a-b378-53c7ff2cc0d5","CVE-2021-3653","OS","High","Unhealthy","A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization. The flaw occurs when processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the ""int_ctl"" field, this issue could allow a malicious L1 to enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest would be allowed to read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape. This vulnerability affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.14-rc7. Another vulnerability, CVE-2021-3656, also affects the KVM hypervisor implementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel. This vulnerability allows a malicious L1 guest to disable VMLOAD/VMSAVE intercepts and VLS (Virtual VMLOAD/VMSAVE) for the L2 guest, enabling the L2 guest to read/write physical pages of the host. The impact of this vulnerability is a crash of the entire system, leakage of sensitive data, or potential guest-to-host escape. The Linux kernel is also vulnerable to a denial of service caused by improper input validation of the ""int_ctl"" VMCB field. This vulnerability can be exploited by a local authenticated attacker to crash the system or obtain sensitive information from the physical memory. Additionally, there are other vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel, including a race condition in the ext4 subsystem, a flaw in the computation of access permissions of a shadow page, an out-of-bounds read flaw in VT, and a flaw in the OverlayFS subsystem that allows a local user to access hidden files.

This flaw can be abused by a local unprivileged attacker to crash systemd services or potentially execute code and elevate their privileges, by sending specially crafted dbus messages. Another vulnerability in systemd allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the system to crash by exploiting a heap use-after-free vulnerability in the bus_verify_polkit_async() function. Additionally, systemd incorrectly handles certain PIDFile files, which can be exploited by a local attacker to trick systemd into killing privileged processes. Another issue in systemd is the mishandling of certain udevadm trigger commands, which can be exploited by a local attacker to cause systemd to consume resources and lead to a denial of service. Furthermore, systemd incorrectly handles services that use the DynamicUser property, allowing a local attacker to access resources owned by a different service in the future. Lastly, systemd mishandles certain Polkit queries, which can be exploited by a local attacker to crash systemd, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code and escalate privileges.

It is vulnerable to multiple flaws that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, cause a denial of service, or crash the application. These vulnerabilities include out-of-bounds reads, heap-based buffer overflows, null pointer dereference, and integer overflows. The highest impact from these vulnerabilities is to system availability, confidentiality, and integrity. Ghostscript, a PostScript and PDF interpreter, is also vulnerable to a flaw that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service by tricking a user into processing a specially crafted image file. Upgrading to the latest versions of OpenJPEG and Ghostscript is recommended to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

This vulnerability can be exploited by calling DMA_FROM_DEVICE function, enabling an attacker to obtain sensitive information and potentially launch further attacks against the affected system. Another vulnerability was discovered in the netfilter subsystem, where a local attacker could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code by exploiting the improper validation of passed user register indices. Additionally, multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities were found in various components of the Linux kernel, including the FUSE file system, ALSA framework, USB Gadget file system interface, ST21NFCA NFC driver, and Xilinx USB2 device gadget driver. These vulnerabilities could lead to system crashes or the execution of arbitrary code. Other vulnerabilities include a NULL pointer dereference flaw in the vmxnet3 networking sub-component, a flaw in the X86 CPU Power management options functionality, a NULL pointer dereference in the slip driver, a seccomp permissions mishandling issue, a use-after-free vulnerability in the proxied virtualized TPM devices, and a double-free flaw in the ems_usb_start_xmit function. Lastly, an integer coercion error in the openvswitch kernel module could allow a local user to crash the system or potentially escalate privileges.

Another vulnerability affects the BPF subsystem, allowing an attacker to bypass Spectre mitigations and read arbitrary kernel memory. Furthermore, a use-after-free flaw in the Bluetooth host controller interface (HCI) can be exploited by a local attacker to cause a denial of service. The Linux kernel's handling of the removal of Bluetooth HCI controllers is also vulnerable to a race condition, leading to memory corruption and possible privilege escalation. Additionally, a denial-of-service flaw has been identified in the netfilter subsystem due to an incorrect memory barrier. Lastly, improper access control in BlueZ may enable an authenticated user to disclose information or impersonate devices in certain Bluetooth protocols.

This flaw allows a local user to gain access to hidden files that should not be accessible. Another vulnerability was found in the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux kernel, which did not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker who could start and control a VM could possibly use this to expose sensitive information or execute arbitrary code. Additionally, the tracing subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly keep track of per-cpu ring buffer state, allowing a privileged attacker to cause a denial of service. The MAX-3421 host USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle device removal events, which could be exploited by a physically proximate attacker to cause a system crash. The Xilinx 10/100 Ethernet Lite device driver in the Linux kernel could report pointer addresses in some situations, which could aid in the exploitation of another vulnerability. Lastly, there are several vulnerabilities affecting different versions of the Linux kernel, including a race condition in the ext4 subsystem, a flaw in computing the access permissions of a shadow page, and an out-of-bounds read flaw in VT.

"c0b7cfc6-3172-465a-b378-53c7ff2cc0d5","CVE-2021-28153","OS","Medium","Unhealthy","An issue was discovered in GNOME GLib before 2.66.8. When g_file_replace() is used with G_FILE_CREATE_REPLACE_DESTINATION to replace a path that is a dangling symlink, it incorrectly also creates the target of the symlink as an empty file, which could conceivably have security relevance if the symlink is attacker-controlled. This vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions and overwrite arbitrary files on the system by persuading a victim to open a specially-crafted ZIP archive. GLib is a core application building block for libraries and applications written in C, providing the core object system used in GNOME, the main loop implementation, and utility functions for strings and common data structures.

Exploitation of this vulnerability can result in a complete compromise of the running graphical session. [Generated by AI]","Apply the latest patches and updates provided by the respective vendors.

One of the vulnerabilities, known as Spectre-BHB or Branch History Injection, allows attackers to influence mispredicted branches and obtain sensitive information through cache allocation. Another vulnerability in Xen allows local authenticated attackers to obtain sensitive information by exploiting the non-transparent sharing of branch predictor selectors. The impact of these vulnerabilities can range from information disclosure to system crashes and privilege escalation. [Generated by AI]","Upgrade to the latest version of the affected Linux kernel. For Arm Cortex and Neoverse processors, upgrade to a version released after 2022-03-08. For Xen, apply the necessary patches or updates provided by the vendor. For other Linux kernels, upgrade to the latest available version. It is recommended to regularly check for security updates and apply them promptly.

"c0b7cfc6-3172-465a-b378-53c7ff2cc0d5","CVE-2022-2153","OS","Medium","Unhealthy","A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's KVM when attempting to set a SynIC IRQ. This issue makes it possible for a misbehaving VMM to write to SYNIC/STIMER MSRs, causing a NULL pointer dereference. This flaw allows an unprivileged local attacker on the host to issue specific ioctl calls, causing a kernel oops condition that results in a denial of service. Another vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's Netfilter subsystem, allowing a local user to crash the system or a remote user to crash the system when the libnetfilter_queue is used by a local user. Additionally, Intel microprocessor generations 6 to 8 are affected by a new Spectre variant that is able to bypass their retpoline mitigation in the kernel to leak arbitrary data. An attacker with unprivileged user access can hijack return instructions to achieve arbitrary speculative code execution under certain microarchitecture-dependent conditions. There is also a use-after-free flaw in the Linux kernel's Atheros wireless adapter driver, allowing a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.

Another vulnerability (CVE-2021-40490) in the ext4 file system allows a local attacker to cause a denial of service or potentially gain administrative privileges due to a race condition when writing xattrs to an inode. Additionally, there are vulnerabilities related to the Atheros Ath9k WiFi driver, KVM hypervisor implementation, and 6pack network protocol driver. Upgrading to the specified package versions is recommended to mitigate these vulnerabilities. [Generated by AI]","Apply the latest patches and updates provided by the respective vendors.

The vulnerabilities include a concurrency use-after-free flaw in the floppy driver (drivers/block/floppy.c) and race conditions in the AX.25 amateur radio protocol implementation and the KVM hypervisor implementation. These vulnerabilities could be exploited by local authenticated attackers to cause a system crash or execute arbitrary code, resulting in a DoS condition. Additionally, a use-after-free vulnerability was found in the implementation of the 6pack and mkiss protocols, which could also lead to a DoS condition. A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a system crash. Another vulnerability was discovered in the AX.25 amateur radio protocol implementation, which could be exploited by a local attacker to cause a system crash or execute arbitrary code. Furthermore, the implementation of the AX.25 amateur radio protocol in the Linux kernel contained race conditions, leading to use-after-free vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a local attacker to cause a system crash. Lastly, the KVM hypervisor implementation did not properly handle guest TLB mapping invalidation requests in some situations, allowing an attacker in a guest VM to cause a system crash in the host OS.

Node.js is also vulnerable to a DoS attack due to an error in the HTTP/2 session frame, which is limited to 32 settings by default. Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition is affected by an easily exploitable vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated attacker to compromise the system via HTTP, resulting in a hang or frequently repeatable crash. The CVSS 3.1 Base Score for this vulnerability is 7.5 (Availability impacts). [Generated by AI]","Apply the latest patches and updates provided by the respective vendors.
